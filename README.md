# Courselector in SUIBE
## 0. Before You Start
This application is based on ___Python 2.x___, so it is supposed to be workable on any plantform with ___Python 2.x___ installed. The Course Selector is designed ___only___ for studnets from ___Shanghai University of International Business and Economics___(SUIBE) to save their time when it comes to course selecting.(Here is the link: http://xk.suibe.edu.cn/)  

In order to run this tool smoothly, some support libraries are also required. They are listed below:  
1. DaPy
2. wx 3.0
3. BeautifulSoup4
4. Selenium
5. PhantomJS
6. Requests
7. Pillow
## 1. Sign up
Before you can really use this app, you have to create an account which need to be bound to your ___student number___. So, technically, every student is allowed to only create one account. Since it is only the first public beta version, signing up is ___totally free of charge___ (for now lol). By simply clciking the 'Sign Up' button, the following window will pop up.
1. Type in your username.
2. Type in your password.
3. Type in your student number. (Be careful, do not type it wrong since it cannot be changed unless you contact me.)
4. Click 'Confirm' button.
## 2. Sign in
Click the 'Sign In' button and another tiny lovely window will pop up. Type in your username and password mentioned in the previous step and press 'enter' on your keyboard. Just wait a second, and then the main frame will show itself.
## 3. Login to the School Course Selecting System
You can see that the blank for your student number is already filled in since your student number is bound to your account. 
The only thing you need to do is to fill in the blanks for password and the verification code.  
***NOTICE: This is your in-school password! Not the one that you use to sign in this app!***   
___DO NOT PRESS THE 'STRT' BUTTON IN THIS STEP___
## 4. Type in the course numbers
The course number (e.g 107.125.201) is a unique identity for every course which you can find on the Course Selecting System website. Enter your course numbers one by one and the final step is ready to go.
## 5. Launching the rocket!
The finall move is the most exciting moment of the day. Wait for the count down as if you are the astronaut in the rocket who is ready to put himself in the universe.

"3...2...1...***START***"  

You are supposed to click the Start button no later than the word 'START' hits the floor. The result will show up within a flash.

For those courses that failed to be selected, their background colour will turn to red and inspection of the course number is required and the colour of those courses that are successfully selected will be green.

Hopefully, all the numbers will become green. 

Now you can smile.
